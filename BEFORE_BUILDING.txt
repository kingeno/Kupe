in Unity :

1) check if all levels are in correct order (Project Window/Scenes)

2) test all levels from start to finish

3) test all levels by loading from the Main Menu AND from a level

4) verify that all the images from the loading level screen are corresponding to loaded levels

5) (about sound)
